Example graph data structure implementation in Huo

This repository contains an example graph data structure implementation in Huo. The graph itself consist of an array that looks like this:
```code
[ 2, 1, [ [0, "Me"], [1, "You] ], [ [0, 1] ] ]
```
Where the first item is the number of nodes, the second is the number of links, the third item is an array of nodes and the fourth an array of links.
